# == (equals) returns true if the values compared are equal.
5 == 5 #=> true
5 == 6 #=> false

# != (not equal) returns true if the values compared are not equal.
5 != 7 #=> true
5 != 5 #=> false

# > (greater than) returns true if the value on the left of the operator is larger than the value on the right.
7 > 5 #=> true
5 > 7 #=> false

# < (less than) returns true if the value on the left of the operator is smaller than the value on the right.
5 < 7 #=> true
7 < 5 #=> false

# >= (greater than or equal to) returns true if the value on the left of the operator is larger than or equal to the value on the right.
7 >= 7 #=> true
7 >= 5 #=> true

# <= (less than or equal to) returns true if the value on the left of the operator is smaller than or equal to the value on the right.
5 <= 5 #=> true
5 <= 7 #=> true


#eql? checks both the value type and the actual value it holds.
5.eql?(5.0) #=> false; although they are the same value, one is an integer and the other is a float
5.eql?(5)   #=> true

#equal? checks whether both values are the exact same object in memory. This can be slightly confusing because of the way computers store some values for efficiency. Two variables pointing to the same number will usually return true.
a = 5
b = 5
a.equal?(b) #=> true
# This expression is true because of the way computers store integers in memory. Although two different variables are holding the number 5, they point to the same object in memory. However, consider the next code example:


a = "hello"
b = "hello"
a.equal?(b) #=> false
# This happens because computers canâ€™t store strings in the same efficient way they store numbers. 
# Although the values of the variables are the same, the computer has created two separate string objects in memory.
