puts """

Local variables are the most common variables you will come across and 
obey all scope boundaries. These variables are declared by starting the 
variable name with neither $ nor @, as well as not capitalizing the 
entire variable name.

Example of a local variable declaration:

"""
var = 'I must be passed around to cross scope boundaries.'
