puts """
Global variables are declared by starting the variable name with the dollar sign ($). 
These variables are available throughout your entire app, overriding all scope boundaries.
 Rubyists tend to stay away from global variables as there can be unexpected complications when using them.

Example of a global variable declaration:

"""
$var = 'I am also available throughout your app.'
