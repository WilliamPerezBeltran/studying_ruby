puts """

Class variables are declared by starting the variable name with two @ signs. 
These variables are accessible by instances of your class, as well as the class itself. 
When you need to declare a variable that is related to a class, but each instance 
of that class does not need its own value for this variable, you use a class variable. 
Class variables must be initialized at the class level, outside of any method definitions. 
They can then be altered using class or instance method definitions.
