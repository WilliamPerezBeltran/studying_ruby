age = 18
age += 4 #=> 22

# There are similar assignment operators for all the common math operators:
age = 18
age -= 2  #=> 16

cash = 10
cash *= 2 #=> 20

temperature = 40
temperature /= 10 #=> 4

# this shorthand assigment is the same as this :

puts age = 18 
puts age = age + 4  
puts "-----"  
puts age = 18 
puts age += 4
