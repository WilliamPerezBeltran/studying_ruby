# this is how to create a variable in Ruby 
age = 18 # =>18

# you can also assign the result of an expression to a variable
age = 18 + 5 # => 23

# Variable nams are reusable, so you can assign a nw valur to 
# a a variable at any point in you 
# program. Naturally, doing so will override the original value
age = 18
age #=> 18
age = 33
age #=> 33
