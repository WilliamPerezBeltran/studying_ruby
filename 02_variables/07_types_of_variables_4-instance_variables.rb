puts """

Instance variables are declared by starting the variable name with one @ sign. 
These variables are available throughout the current instance of the parent class. 
Instance variables can cross some scope boundaries, but not all of them. You will 
learn more about this when you get to OOP topics, and should not use instance variables 
until you know more about them.

Example of an instance variable declaration:

"""
@var = 'I am available throughout the current instance of this class.'
