puts """
Ruby lets us use something called a range to define an interval. 
All we need to do is give Ruby the starting value, the ending value, 
and whether we want the range to be inclusive or exclusive.
"""
# example 1

(1..5) # => inclusive range: 1 2 3 4 5
(1...10) # => exluisiveinclusive range: 1 2 3 4 

# We can make ranges of letters, too!
('a'..'d')  # a, b, c, d
