puts """
If you need to run a loop for a specified number of times, 
then look no further than the trusty #times loop. 
It works by iterating through a loop a specified number of 
times and even throws in the bonus of accessing the number itâ€™s 
currently iterating through.

# example 1
5.times do |number|
	puts number
